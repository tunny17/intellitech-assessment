            Coming from a science background, not many people would have expected Blessing Abeng to become a force in the marketing and communications industry. <br>
            Yet, she has been a part of building successful companies like Disha and Ingressive for Good (I4G) from the ground up. <br>
        </p>    
        <h4> How did Ingressive for Good start? </h4> <br>

        <p>
            Ingressive for Good launched July 1, 2020, in the peak of the COVID lockdown. Before this, Ingressive Capital, a venture firm led by Maya Horgan, had a <br>
            small-scale CSR project that involved connecting student communities with global tech companies like Github and Figma. <br>
            We also randomly paid for students’ school fees and bought them laptops. After a while, we paused our approach and interviewed some of our beneficiaries and <br>
            tech stakeholders. This interview revealed that in addition to getting training and tools, people wanted jobs too. <br>
            On Ingressive Capital’s side, they realised that finding the right talent is one of the biggest challenges startups face. This is why we thought of creating Ingressive<br>
            for Good, a nonprofit dedicated to helping young Africans increase their earning power by developing tech skills and landing jobs. <br>
        </p>
        <h4> Since Ingressive for Good was an off-shoot of Ingressive Capital, you must have had enough resources to kickstart operations, correct? </h4> <br>

        <p>
            Years ago, I met Maya Horgan, the founder of Ingressive Capital, while I and my partner were running Startup Grind Lagos. We invited her to speak at our <br>
            monthly event, and we connected from there. She loved my work, followed me on social media and we got acquainted. One time, she tried getting me to run <br>
            communications at Ingressive Capital, but I declined because I had other commitments. <br>

            But when she told me about Ingressive for Good in 2020, I was excited to join her and Sean Burrowes as a founding member. I’m great at being creative and<br>
            analytical, so this came in handy when Ingressive for Good began operations. I took ownership of my communications role and got involved in important <br>
            conversations like I was a co-founder. <br>

            One time, we were at a donor meeting, and I answered most of the questions the donors threw at us. Right after that call, Maya and Sean invited me to <br>
            be a co-founder. According to them, I was already handling the nonprofit like it was mine. So why not? <br>
        </p>
        <h4> Given how Disha and I4G weren’t exactly profitable when you first joined them, did stopping your agency affect your finances?</h4> <br>

        <p>
            Not at all. I had saved and invested enough money to sustain me for years while running my agency, and I had digital content raking in passive income.<br>
            I also occasionally freelanced as a branding consultant. Overall, I had sufficient funds to live comfortably. <br>
